Congratulations! You've managed to build a complete Mixer adapter and have validated
that it works via local testing.

Follow these steps to deploy a Mixer with your custom adapter to your service
mesh for use:
  * [Build a docker image of Mixer with your custom adapter](#make-and-push-a-docker-image-of-mixer-with-your-custom-adapter)
  * [Generate the appropriate CRD for your custom adapter](#generate-the-appropriate-crd-for-your-custom-adapter)
  * [Deploy your CRD](#deploy-your-crd)
  * [Edit the Mixer deployment configuration to reference your new image](#edit-the-mixer-deployment-configuration-to-reference-your-new-image)
  * [Celebrate](#celebrate)

NOTE:
  * All commands should be executed from the root of the istio.io/istio directory.
  * These instructions assume that the steps will be executed on a Linux distro.
    Other OSes are not currently supported.

These instructions assume that:
  * `docker`, `kubectl`, and `gcloud` commands are installed.
  * `kubectl` has been configured and is authorized to push to a cluster


1. #### Make and push a docker image of Mixer with your custom adapter

   Execute the following command, replacing the `HUB` and `TAG` values with
   appropriate values for your environment:

   ```bash
   make HUB=<HUB> TAG=<TAG> push.docker.mixer
   ```

   If you have set `HUB` and `TAG` in a `~./profile` or a `.istiorc.mk` file, you
   can omit those arguments from the command.

   This should produce output similar to:

   ```
   mkdir -p /usr/local/google/home/dougreid/go/out/linux_amd64/release/docker_temp
   cp docker/ca-certificates.tgz /usr/local/google/home/dougreid/go/out/linux_amd64/release/docker_temp

1. #### Generate the appropriate CRD for your custom adapter

   The Mixer binary has a utility for generating the Custom Resource Definitions
   for adapters. Invoke this utility as follows:

   ```bash
   $GOPATH/out/linux_amd64/release/mixs crd adapter
   ```

   Find the stanza for your custom adapter and save it to a file, named
   something like `custom-crd.yaml`.

   The `custom-crd.yaml` file you generate should look similar to:

   ```yaml
   kind: CustomResourceDefinition
   apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
   metadata:
     name: stdios.config.istio.io
     labels:
       package: stdio
       istio: mixer-adapter
   spec:
     group: config.istio.io
     names:
       kind: stdio
       plural: stdios
       singular: stdio
     scope: Namespaced
     version: v1alpha2
   ```

1. #### Deploy your CRD

   Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f custom-crd.yaml
   ```

1. #### Edit the Mixer deployment configuration to reference your new image

   If you already have a Mixer instance running from a previous deployment of
   Istio, execute the following commands:

   1. Execute the following command to open the configuration for the Mixer deployment.

      ```bash
      kubectl -n istio-system edit deployment istio-mixer
      ```

   1. Change the `image` for the Mixer binary to match the tag for your new image.

      The `image` specification to change will look similar to:

      ```
      image: gcr.io/istio-testing/mixer:18a20f98c6e5d92817b9b00ed94c089f4e73aeec
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      name: mixer
      ```

      Update `image` with the image tag for your image. Pay careful attention to
      the `imagePullPolicy` if you are attempting to reuse a tag. Exit and Save
      the file.     

      The expected output is:

      ```bash
      deployment "istio-mixer" edited
      ```

   1. Please also update the Istio configuration specification (so that your
      changes are preserved).

      Append the contents of `custom-crd.yaml` to `install/kubernetes/helm/istio/charts/mixer/templates/crds.yaml`.

      Be sure to a new label in the `metadata/labels` section that matches:
      ```yaml
      app: {{ template "mixer.name" . }}
      ```      

   1. Then regenerate the install artifacts via:   
      ```bash
      make generate_yaml
      ```

      You will need to update the `istio.yaml` (or similar) artifact to the image
      you built in the previous steps.


   If you do not already have a Mixer instance running, deploy Istio as follows
   (assuming `istio.yaml` is the desired deployment):

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/istio.yaml
   ```

 1. #### Celebrate

    Woohoo! A new Mixer, built with your adapter code, should now be running in
    your cluster. Configure a handler for your custom adapter and begin sending
    it instances!
