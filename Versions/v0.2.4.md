*Note:* You need Kubernetes 1.7.4 to try this early build. Earlier versions of kubernetes are no longer supported, as we rely on CustomResourceDefinitions (a feature available since k8s 1.7). To get automatic injection cluster wide, you also need Alpha Features.

**Warning:** The next pre-release (0.2.6) may have incompatible changes with this build.

**Warning:** RBAC alpha isn't supported (use RBAC beta which all K8s 1.7+ have)
