*Note:* You need Kubernetes 1.7.4 with Alpha Features to try this early build. Earlier versions of kubernetes are no longer supported, as we rely on CustomResourceDefinitions (a feature available since k8s 1.7)

**Warning:** The next pre-release (0.2.4) will have incompatible changes with this build.

**Warning:** RBAC alpha isn't supported (use RBAC beta which all K8s 1.7+ have)
