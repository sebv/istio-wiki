* Out-of-process (gRPC) Adapters

  We want to enable Mixer integration with requiring custom builds of Mixer to enable new adapter functionality. This topic is concerned with how Mixer will integrate with out-of-process adapters, how such adapters will be deployed and managed, and how configuration of the adapters will be handled. Additional sub-topics include debugging and testing.
