*Note:* You need Kubernetes 1.7.4 to try this build. Earlier versions of kubernetes are no longer supported, as we rely on CustomResourceDefinitions (a feature available since k8s 1.7). To get automatic injection cluster wide, you also need Alpha Features.

**Warning:** RBAC alpha isn't supported (use RBAC beta which all K8s 1.7+ have)
