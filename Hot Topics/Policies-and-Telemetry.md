Current hot topics for the Policies and Telemetry working group

* Out-of-process (gRPC) Adapters

  We want to enable Mixer integration with requiring custom builds of Mixer to enable new adapter functionality. This topic is concerned with how Mixer will integrate with out-of-process adapters, how such adapters will be deployed and managed, and how configuration of the adapters will be handled. Additional sub-topics include debugging and testing.

* Configuration scheme

  Mixer currently uses multiple distinct Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to capture the individual configuration for adapters and instance types. This proliferation of configuration resources causes a number of issues, not least of which is configuration burden. We want to simplify the Mixer configuration story, consolidating on three/four higher-level CRDs that can model the same information.

* Three

* Four

* Five
